# CS255-Portfolio

The purpose was to create a comprehensive system for DriverPass, a client seeking to offer online and road tests, improve road safety, and meet DMV regulations. The client wanted the system to manage student information, track progress, enable reservations, and ensure compliance with the DMV.

The system needed various components: a web-based interface for computers, iOS and Android apps for mobile devices, user authentication, data storage, notifications, and integration with cloud services.

The objectives included flexibility, offline capability, reservation updates, notification delivery, cloud connectivity, test history display, and data input fields.

Nonfunctional requirements covered performance in various environments, platform constraints (web, iOS, Android), accuracy and precision of user identification, adaptability to changes, security (logins, data exchange, password reset), and functional requirements like login validation, password reset, information modification, progress tracking, rule updates, and user info display.

The user interface needed to cater to different users, displaying test progress, notes, and photos. Users would interact via mouse/keyboard on computers or touch on mobile devices.

Assumptions included users' familiarity with device operation, while limitations encompassed factors like screen size, budget constraints, and technology limitations.
